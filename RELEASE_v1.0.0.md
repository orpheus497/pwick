## Testing

### Run Tests
```bash
# Unit tests
python -m unittest tests.test_vault -v

# Integration test
python tests/test_integration.py
```

### Test Results
- ✅ 8 unit tests passing
- ✅ 1 integration test passing
- ✅ CodeQL security analysis: 0 alerts
- ✅ No deprecation warnings
- ✅ Encryption verified (no plaintext in vault files)

## Security Considerations

### Threat Model
**Protected Against:**
- ✅ Brute-force attacks (expensive key derivation)
- ✅ Dictionary attacks (strong KDF with unique salts)
- ✅ Data tampering (authenticated encryption)
- ✅ Data theft (encrypted at rest)
- ✅ Rainbow table attacks (unique salt per vault)
- ✅ Clipboard history leakage (auto-clear, daily refresh)

**User Responsibility:**
- Master password strength (unrecoverable if forgotten)
- System security (keyloggers, screen capture, physical access)
- Regular backups via export functionality

### Best Practices
1. Use a strong master password (12+ characters, mixed case, numbers, symbols)
2. Write down master password and store securely (it cannot be recovered)
3. Lock vault when stepping away from computer
4. Export vault regularly for backup
5. Store vault file on encrypted drives for additional security

## Future Considerations

While pwick v1.0.0 is feature-complete, potential future enhancements could include:

1. **Configuration Options**: Adjustable clipboard timeout, history size
2. **Enhanced Search**: Full-text search across entries
3. **Tags/Categories**: Organize entries with tags
4. **Password Strength Meter**: Visual feedback on password strength
5. **Vault Statistics**: Entry count, creation dates, usage stats
6. **Multiple Vault Support**: Switch between different vaults
7. **Backup Automation**: Scheduled automatic exports
8. **Audit Log**: Track vault access and modifications

Note: Any future features will maintain the core philosophy of being local-first with no network connections.
