- **Key Derivation:** Argon2id (3 iterations, 64 MB memory, unique salt per vault)
- **Encrypted Clipboard:** AES-256-GCM encryption before copying passwords to system clipboard
  - Session-unique encryption key prevents cross-session attacks
  - Format: `PWICK_ENC:<base64_encrypted_data>`
  - Prevents OS telemetry and clipboard snooping
- **Auto-Clear:** Clipboard automatically cleared after 30 seconds
- **No Network:** Zero external connections, complete privacy

### Interface
- **System Tray:** Minimize to tray, run in background, double-click to restore
- **Dark Theme:** Black/grey/white/red color scheme
- **Keyboard Shortcuts:** Ctrl+C, Ctrl+N, Ctrl+E, Delete, Ctrl+L, Ctrl+F
- **Password Generator:** 20-character cryptographically secure passwords
- **Clipboard History:** Last 30 copied items (refreshes daily)
- **Entry Management:** Full CRUD operations with title, username, password, notes

### Packaging
- **Cross-Platform:** Windows and Linux support
- **Installation Scripts:** install.bat (Windows), install.sh (Linux/Mac)
- **Uninstall Scripts:** Clean removal preserving vault files

- **8 Unit Tests:** All passing ✓
- **Integration Tests:** Complete workflows verified ✓
- **CodeQL Security:** 0 alerts ✓
- **Cross-Platform:** Tested on Linux ✓

## Documentation

- **README.md:** 148 lines - current state, installation, usage
- **CHANGELOG.md:** 63 lines - v1.0.0 release notes
- **SECURITY.md:** Security model and threat analysis
- **TESTING.md:** Testing procedures
- **QUICKREF.md:** Keyboard shortcuts reference

## Technical Limitations

### NOT Implemented (Technical/Architectural Constraints)

1. **Global Clipboard Monitoring:**
   - Would require OS-level hooks with admin/root privileges
   - OS-specific implementation (Windows API, X11/Wayland on Linux)
   - Security software may flag as malware
   - Violates local-first, no-network philosophy
   - Beyond scope of password manager

2. **Keyboard Encryption (Anti-Keylogging):**
   - Would require kernel-level hooks
   - Considered malware-like behavior by security software
   - Cannot prevent OS-level telemetry without system modifications
   - Not feasible within application scope

### What IS Protected

- **pwick's Password Copies:** All passwords copied by pwick are encrypted before hitting system clipboard
- **Clipboard History:** Passwords stored in pwick's history panel are encrypted
- **Vault Data:** All stored data is encrypted at rest
- **Session Security:** Master password exists only in memory

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
./install.sh  # Linux/Mac
install.bat   # Windows

# Run
pwick

# Create vault, set master password, add entries
# Copy password: Ctrl+C (encrypted, auto-clears in 30s)
# System tray: Close window to minimize, double-click icon to restore
```
