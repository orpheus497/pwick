## Philosophy: Your Data is Yours. Period.

In an age of constant cloud syncing and data breaches, pwick is intentionally different. We believe your most sensitive information—your passwords—should remain completely and totally under your control.

* **No Cloud:** There is no "sync" feature. There are no servers. Your vault is a single file on your local disk.
* **No Tracking:** The application includes no analytics, no tracking pixels, and no network "check-ins."
* **Total Privacy:** You are the only person who can access your data.

---

## Features

* 🔒 **100% Local-First:** Your vault is a single, encrypted file on your computer.
* 🔑 **Strong Encryption:** Your entire vault is encrypted using [**Specify Algorithm, e.g., AES-256**] with a key derived from your Master Password.
* 💻 **Cross-Platform:** Works natively on both **Windows** and **Linux**.
* 🔄 **Easy Backup & Transfer:** Securely export your *entire* encrypted vault to a single file. Move it to a new device via a USB drive (or any other method) and import it seamlessly.
* ✨ **Simple Interface:** A clean, no-nonsense UI focused on one thing: managing your passwords securely.

## How to Use

### 1. First-Time Setup

When you first launch the application, you will be asked to create a new vault.

1.  Choose **"Create New Vault"**.
2.  Set your **Master Password**.

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Your Master Password is the *only* key to your data. It is never stored by us and cannot be recovered. If you forget your Master Password, your data is lost forever. Write it down and store it somewhere safe.**

### 2. Daily Use

* Use your Master Password to unlock your vault.
* Add, edit, copy, or delete your password entries.
* Lock the vault when you step away from your computer to keep it secure.

## Backup and Device Transfer

You can easily move your *entire* vault between devices without any cloud service.

### To Export (Backup)

1.  Unlock your vault.
2.  Navigate to `File > Export Encrypted Vault`.
3.  Choose a name and location to save your encrypted file (e.g., `my-pwick-vault.encrypted`).
4.  Securely copy this single file to a USB drive or other offline media.

This file contains all your data, but it remains fully encrypted by your Master Password.

### To Import (Transfer to New Device)

1.  Install pwick on your new computer.
2.  Copy your exported file (e.g., `my-pwick-vault.encrypted`) to the new device.
3.  On the application's welcome screen, choose **"Import Existing Vault"**.
4.  Select your file.
5.  Enter the **same Master Password** you used to create the vault.

Your vault will be decrypted and loaded locally on the new machine.

## Security Model

* **Encryption at Rest:** Your local vault file is fully encrypted using [**Specify Algorithm, e.g., AES-256-GCM**].
* **Key Derivation:** Your Master Password is run through a strong key derivation function ([**Specify KDF, e.g., Argon2id or PBKDF2**]) to create the encryption key. This makes brute-force attacks much more difficult.
* **No Plaintext:** Your Master Password is never stored on disk, not even in a hashed form. It is only held in memory when the vault is unlocked.
